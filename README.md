# Image segmentation
 Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments or regions based on certain characteristics such as color, intensity, texture, or other visual properties. The goal is to simplify the representation of an image into more meaningful and easier to analyze parts. Segmentation is a crucial step in various computer vision tasks, including object detection, recognition, and scene understanding.
